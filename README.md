#My Little Rainbow
In this tutorial we're going to make a rainbow with HTML `<div>` tags.  
And while we do it we're going to learn about html elements, css styling, css selectors, 
how color works in css, and importing stylesheets.  That might sound like a lot but it isn't.

##HTML Basics
Hyper Text Markup Language, or HTML, is a way to demarcate a document into different parts.  
Each part is _marked_ by elements (aka tags).  Each element has it's own special conotation;

Elements (or tags)
  - All HTML begin with `<` and end with `>` ex. `<div>`
